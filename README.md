# Welcome to My GitHub!

Hi there! I'm Ahron Chetrit, a Windows Security Researcher passionate about cybersecurity, reverse engineering, and cryptography. This is where I showcase my projects and contributions in the world of security research.

## About Me

I specialize in:

- **Windows Internals & EDR Bypassing:** Developing techniques to bypass security mechanisms like EDRs, ASR, and DLP using C, C++, and WinAPI.
- **Malware Development:** Creating and studying malware to understand and demonstrate security vulnerabilities.
- **Reverse Engineering:** Analyzing software to bypass EDRs, exploit vulnerabilities, and enhance cyber defense strategies. I use tools like IDA Free and x64dbg extensively.
- **Threat Hunting:** Investigating and responding to security threats using KQL for developing rules and advanced hunting.
- **Cloud Development:** Working on secure cloud infrastructure and implementing best practices for platforms like Azure.
- **Web Development:** Building and securing web applications using modern technologies.

## Notable Projects

- **[Undetected LSASS Dumper & Mimikatz Runner](https://github.com/ahron-chet/Guard-Bypass-Toolkit-LSASS-Dumper-and-Mimikatz-Runner)**: A project demonstrating bypassing Microsoft EDR to run Mimikatz in-memory, using techniques like manual PE loading, EAT hooking, and memory manipulation. Includes anti-hooking by processing DLL EAT, calculating actual memory addresses, and updating IAT with unhooked functions. Uses a callback function to manipulate buffers and bypass Defender while dumping LSASS.

- **[Command & Control Framework](https://github.com/ahron-chet/NeptoonC2)**: An advanced Command and Control (C2) tool for various attack simulations, including features like encrypted communications, full cryptographic infrastructure, and AI integration.

- **[PE-Loader & EAT Hooking](https://github.com/ahron-chet/EAT-Functions-Hooking)**: A project focused on manually loading PE files and hooking Export Address Table (EAT) functions to bypass security mechanisms.

- **[Asymmetric Encryption Algorithms](https://github.com/ahron-chet/Asymmetric-encryption-algorithms-RSA-Elgamal-Diffie-Hellman)**: Implementations of RSA, ElGamal, and Diffie-Hellman algorithms in Python, covering all the mathematical details behind them.
