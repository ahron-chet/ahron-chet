ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on enhancing my Command and Control (C2) framework and developing advanced EDR bypass techniques.  

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about Windows internals, EDR bypassing, and cryptographic algorithms.  

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects related to malware development and reverse engineering.
